# ClientGPT

ClientGPT is an application designed to interact with large language models. Ideally you need to have your own models deployed (ex. LM Studio). You can then build this as a web app üñ•Ô∏è or android app üì±.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Dialogue emulates the structured exchange of information between a User and an inferred GPT model, characterized by input provided by the User and corresponding output generated by the model. Also supports a bit of markdown formatting.
- **Chat History**: Stores interactions as a log of chat history.
- **Server Configuration**: Enables the user to specify the server configuration for hosting their models.
